# plasma

Plasma is composed of two key parts of the design: Reframing all blockchain computation into a set of MapReduce functions, and on optional method to do Proof-of_stake token bonding on top of existing blockchains with the understanding that the Nakamoto Consensus incentives discourage block withholding.    *??*

## Scalable Multi-Party Computation

This assert/challenge construction allows one to assert a particalar state is correct, and if the value is incorrect, then a dispute peroid exists where another observer can provide a proof challenging that assertion before a vertain agreed time.

This needs to be able to minimizing the state updates in the root blockchain necessary in the event of byzantine actors to prevent risk-discounted transaction fees on the root chain, and a mechanism to enforce state changes.
